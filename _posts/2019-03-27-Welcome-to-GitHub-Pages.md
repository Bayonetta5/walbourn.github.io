Sorry for having been quiet for so long. In addition to the usual holiday lull, I've also been working on migrating this blog to GitHub Pages which has necessitated a lot of manual cleanup and formatting moving from WordPress to Markdown. In any case, the new location for the <em>Games for Windows and DirectX SDK blog</em> is now: <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/">https://walbourn.github.io/</a>. The new site has the entire archive by <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/archive/">month</a> and <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/tags/">tag</a>.

You may or may not have also noticed some other DirectX and related blogs have migrated recently as well, so now is a good time to update your bookmarks:

My GitHub Pages blog is much leaner and loads faster, and personally I find it a lot easier to work in git and a Markdown editor instead of a web interface. That said, my new blog no longer supports comments. While unfortunate, there are still plenty of ways to provide feedback on relevant topics. Each of my GitHub projects has an issues tracker, and I routinely monitor DirectX related tags on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
