DirectXMath version 3.11 is now available on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmath/3.1.1">NuGet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMath">GitHub</a>. It will be included in the <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-fall-creators-update-sdk/"><em>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update SDK</em></a>, the <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-april-2018-update-sdk/">Windows 10 April 2018 Update SDK</a>, and the Xbox One XDK (June 2017 or later).

<ul>
 	<li>AVX optimization of <code>XMMatrixMultiply</code> and <code>XMMatrixMultiplyTranspose</code></li>
 	<li>AVX2 optimization for <code>XMVectorSplatX</code></li>
 	<li>FMA3 optimization of <code>XMVectorMultiplyAdd</code> and <code>XMVectorNegativeMultiplySubtract</code></li>
 	<li>Conformance fixes to support compilation with Clang 3.7</li>
</ul>

The main addition for this version are the control defines for <code>_XM_AVX2_INTRINSICS_</code> and <code>_XM_FMA3_INTRINSICS_</code>, both of which are enabled when using <code>/arch:AVX2</code> along with the already existing <code>_XM_F16C_INTRINSICS_</code>. For details on the few AVX2 optimizations applicable to DirectXMath see <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-avx2/">this blog post,</a> and for FMA3 see <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-f16c-and-fma/">this post</a>. This means that when you build using ``/arch:AVX2``, the <code>XMVerifyCPUSupport</code> function will explicitly check for AVX2, FMA3, and F16C processor support.

<h1>Down the Conformance Rabbit Hole</h1>

For this release I did a fair amount of syntax cleanup for better C++11/C++14 conformance by getting the headers to build without warnings when using the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clang-with-microsoft-codegen-in-vs-2015-update-1/">Clang 3.7 compiler with Microsoft codegen</a>. I can't speak to the quality or correctness of the generated code, but I wanted to make sure the source code was as conforming as I could make it--VS 2017's <code>/permissive-</code> <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/permissive-switch/">standard enforcement switch</a> helps, but there's no substitute for trying to build with a different compiler toolset.

A basic issue is that intrinsics themselves are implementation dependent, and in particular the way that the type ``__m128`` is defined is not consistent between Visual C++ and Clang. Visual C++ treats it as a union, while Clang considers it a special opaque type. Therefore, I had to modify all places where the members of the ``__m128`` union were being manipulated. This is pretty easy because I already have portable unions that work: <code>XMVECTORF32</code>, <code>XVMECTORU32</code>, and <code>XMVECTORI32</code>.

A knock-on impact of the way the ``__m128`` type is defined means that you <em>can</em> overload free functions based on it with Visual C++, but you <em>cannot</em> do so with Clang. In other words, this is legal C++ with Visual C++ but not when using Clang:

```cpp
__m128 operator+(__m128 V);
```

Rather than break existing users of these overloads on Visual C++, I guard their definition with a new control define, <code>_XM_NO_XMVECTOR_OVERLOADS_</code>, which I automatically enable when building with Clang. This also meant updating all the places in the other DirectXMath implementation headers where I relied on the overloads to use explicit functions instead. Note that there's no equivalent issue with <code>XMMATRIX</code> overloads because this is itself a struct.

The bulk of the remaining conformance changes were fully bracing the initialization of <code>XMVECTORF32</code> and related types:

```cpp
static const XMVECTORF32 c_value = { 1.f, 2.f, 3.f, 4.f };
```

had to be changed to:

```cpp
static const XMVECTORF32 c_value = { { { 1.f, 2.f, 3.f, 4.f } } };
```

It also turns out that the Clang compiler doesn't like the trick used by the <code>UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER</code> macro. Instead of having:

```cpp
XMVECTOR Permute(FXMVECTOR v1, FXMVECTOR v2) { (v2); return XM_PERMUTE_PS(v1, Shuffle); }
```

The name of the unreferenced formal parameter has to be removed to make both compilers happy:

```cpp
XMVECTOR Permute(FXMVECTOR v1, FXMVECTOR) { return XM_PERMUTE_PS(v1, Shuffle); }
```

I also added guards to <code>#pragma prefast</code> statements which Clang complains about (although it ignores other common <code>#pragma</code> statements such as <code>#pragma warning</code>)
