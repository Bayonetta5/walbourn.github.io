DirectXMath version 3.07 is included in the <em>Windows 8.1 SDK Spring 2015 Update</em> and <em>Windows Phone 8.1 SDK Spring 2015 Update</em> that ships with VS 2015 and <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-2013-update-5/">VS 2013 Update 5</a>. It is also included in the Windows 10 SDK. See the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/build-2015-news-visual-studio-code-visual-studio-2015-rc-team-foundation-server-2015-rc-visual-studio-2013-update-5/">Visual Studio blog</a>, the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-studio-2015-rc-now-available/">Visual C++ Team blog</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2015/04/29/https://devblogs.microsoft.com/somasegar/introducing-visual-studio-code-visual-studio-2015-rc-application-insights-public-preview-and-net-core-preview-for-linux-and-mac/">Soma's blog</a> for more details on these releases.

This new version includes fixes for the issues covered in <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/known-issues-directxmath-3-06/">Known Issues: DirectXMath 3.06</a>:

<ul>
 	<li>Fix customer reported bugs in <code>BoundingBox</code> methods</li>
 	<li>Fix customer reported bug in <code>XMStoreFloat3SE</code></li>
 	<li>Fix customer reported bug in <code>XMVectorATan2</code>, <code>XMVectorATan2Est</code></li>
 	<li>Fix customer reported bug in <code>XMVectorRound</code></li>
</ul>

There were a few other minor but important changes as well. Primarily it was cleaning up all warnings generated by the new VS 2015 compiler 'by default' with the DirectXMath headers. There was also a more subtle change in that DirectXMath 3.07 now implicitly includes ``<math.h>`` rather than ``<cmath>``, which means that using DirectXMath no longer implicitly picks up a dependency on the "STL" and it's potential to generate a link-time error (LNK2038) due to the ``_MSC_VER`` and/or ``_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL`` stamp mismatch in static libraries built with older versions of the toolset or different configurations. Resolving this second issue had the side-effect of fixing the long-standing problem with the Windows 8.1 SDK / Windows Phone 8.1 SDK's <code>xapobase.lib</code> static helper library for the ARM platform.

<strong>VS 2015:</strong> DirectXMath 3.06 and 3.03 trigger some warnings with the VS 2015 toolset that are fixed in DirectXMath 3.07.
