In the DirectX SDK (June 2010) release, the HLSL compiler was updated from the August 2009 version. As part of this update, the HLSL complier now supports a new feature: <em>symbolic derivatives</em>. If you are interested in learning more about what this feature is and what you can do with it, you should check out this paper from Microsoft Research: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/symbolic-differentiation-in-gpu-shaders/">Symbolic Differentiation in GPU Shaders</a>

<strong>Update:</strong>  The researcher's <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/bguenter/">home page</a> contains more information and the sample is on the MSR download <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/d3910517-487d-4132-a31c-2484be3905fe/">site</a>. Note that the tools make use of the XNA Game Studio 3.1 assemblies, and the redistributable package can be obtained directly from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=53867a2a-e249-4560-8011-98eb3e799ef2">MS Downloads</a>.

There is also a Game Developer Conference 2011 presentation on this topic.
