<p>One of our areas of focus for the DirectX SDK (June 2010) release was to make sure our samples supported Direct3D 11 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chuckw/archive/2010/06/10/directx-11-hardware-vendor-differences.aspx" title="DirectX 11 Hardware Vendor Differences">hardware from NVIDIA</a>, as we had previously only had AMD/ATI Direct3D 11 hardware to work with.&nbsp;There were a few issues that arose right around the release with the <em>SubD11</em> and <em>PNTriangles</em>11<em> </em>samples. At the time we thought it was related to the driver, but in fact it turned out to be due to tessellation shader related optimization issues in the June 2010 version of the HLSL complier.</p>
<p>A work-around is available and is described in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article #<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2448404" title="2448404">2448404</a>.</p>
