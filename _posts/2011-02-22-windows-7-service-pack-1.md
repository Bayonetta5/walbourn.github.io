Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 is now available on Windows Update, MSDN Subscriber Downloads, and TechNet. The announcement from the Windows team can be read on the <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2011/02/22/windows-7-sp1-now-available-for-everyone.aspx">Windows Team Blog</a>, and one from the server team can be found <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2011/02/09/windows-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7-sp1-releases-to-manufacturing-today.aspx">here</a>.

<p>For Windows 7, Service Pack 1 is primarily a roll-up of fixes. Detailed documentation can be found on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=61924cea-83fe-46e9-96d8-027ae59ddc11&displaylang=en">MS Downloads</a>. SP1 includes some performance improvements for Direct2D/DirectWrite and the WARP10 software renderer (see KB <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028560">2028560</a>), and provide OS-level support for the Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/avx/">AVX</a>).</p>
<p>For Windows Server 2008 R2, Service Pack 1 includes the same fixes plus adds two new server features: Dynamic Memory and RemoteFX.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Support for Windows 7 RTM ended on April 9, 2013. Mainstream support for Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 ended on January 13, 2015. Extended support for Windows 7 SP1 will continue until January 14, 2020. See the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/lifecycle">Windows lifecycle fact sheet</a>. In short, if you are still using Windows 7, it needs to be Windows 7 Service Pack 1.</p>
<p><strong>VS 2015:</strong> Note that <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-2015-rtm/">Visual Studio 2015</a> can target Windows 7 Service Pack 1, but the VS 2015 C/C++ Runtime does not support Windows 7 RTM.</p>
