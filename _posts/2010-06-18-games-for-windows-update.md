The DirectX SDK (June 2010) release includes updates to the <em>Games for Windows</em> technical articles (v1.4.0010). There were no significant changes to the technical requirements, but this release includes a number of minor clarifications and some notes on Visual Studio 2010. As always, this pair of documents is an excellent starting point for current Windows Gaming best practices particularly around deployment. The appendix contains important recommendations for game middleware vendors, as well as a list of technology showcases game developers should consider for their titles.
