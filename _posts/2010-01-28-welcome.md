<P>After 5 years of focusing on game developer relations at Microsoft, I recently accepted a new position as the Lead Developer for the DirectX SDK. My work in the <EM>XNA Developer Connection</EM> group has included numerous contributions to the <I>DirectX SDK</I> over the past few years, particularly samples and whitepapers, as well as keeping up various utilities and getting XNAMath shipped as a new cross-platform C++ SIMD library in both the <I>Xbox 360 XDK</I> and <I>DirectX SDK</I>. As such, the new role seems like a natural shift in focus rather than an entirely new job.</P>

<P>I've been heavily involved with professional game developer events (Gamefest, Game Developer Conference, etc.) as well as active on various community forums such as the DirectXDev mailing lists and the Microsoft MVP newsgroups, and I plan to continue to participate in this kind of customer outreach as time permits. Getting back into the product development rat race, however, means not having as much time to invest in articles and presentations as when it was my primary role at the company. Therefore, I've created this blog as an outlet for sharing news and information on all manner of topics related to Windows Gaming, DirectX 11 development, C++ native coding, and of course the SDKs I work with on a daily basis.</P>
